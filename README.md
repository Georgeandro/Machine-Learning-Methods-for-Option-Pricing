# Machine-Learning-Methods-for-Option-Pricing
Google Colab notebooks using PyTorch for option pricing via neural networks. Implements Black-Scholes, Heston, and Lifted Heston models. Combines TDGF time-discretized training with gated architectures and whole-domain PDE loss minimization DGM, enabling accurate and efficient option pricing.
